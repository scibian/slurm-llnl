Description: Increase size of sacctmgr read buffer
 This patch significantly increases the size of the buffer for reading dumps
 with sacctmgr load. Without this patch, sacctmgr is not able to handle lines
 with more than 4096 which is too small in some cases. Also removed useless
 macro definition in other related file.
